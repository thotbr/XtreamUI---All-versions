You may need this if you;
-forget your password
-do not remember username of admin
-after a database migration.
-exposed password unintentionally.


We will use mysql querries and it will be admin/admin again.

-Using SSH: 

sudo mysql

-Now type: 

UPDATE xtream_iptvpro.reg_users SET password='$6$rounds=20000$xtreamcodes$XThC5OwfuS0YwS4ahiifzF14vkGbGsFF1w7ETL4sRRC5sOrAWCjWvQJDromZUQoQuwbAXAFdX3h3Cp3vqulpS0' WHERE id='1';

UPDATE xtream_iptvpro.reg_users SET username = 'admin' WHERE id = '1';

UPDATE xtream_iptvpro.reg_users SET member_group_id = '1' WHERE id = '1';

[b]BACKUPS[/b]
If backups aren't working for you, run the following command:
[code]sudo chown xtreamcodes:xtreamcodes /home/xtreamcodes/iptv_xtream_codes/adtools/backups/[/code]


[b]PROCESS MONITORING[/b]
So I've made a process killer that checks all PID's in the database against live PID's on the server, killing any it doesn't need. This could potentially help people running into CPU issues, or just help in general as XC isn't the best at killing PID's.

pid_monitor.zip


To install it, download the file from above and extract it here (on each server you want it running on, include LB's):
[code]/home/xtreamcodes/iptv_xtream_codes/crons/[/code]


[b]INSTALL[/b]

For manual update, download the release from the link below.
